# AGENTS.md

## Project description

This is an Astro site. It is a blog that aims to help me write all my experiences as developer so that I can have a living curriculum of my knowledge on the field. Also, it is a contribution for those that want to learn a bit about a subject I wrote about.

## General idea

My posts will be mostly technical. I want to have some kind of summary of things I did and learn in different projects or tasks in those projects. Ideally I can use it as my own source of knowledge when I need to go back to something I worked on before without going to the code (that maybe I lost since it was part of another client).

## Posts information

- Posts live in `src/content/posts`
- Their shape is defined in `src/content/config.ts`

## Commands

- Run dev blog: `pnpm run dev`
- Build blog: `pnpm run build`
- Previr blog: `pnpm run preview`

## Deploys

I'm using github actions to deploy the blog to a github page
