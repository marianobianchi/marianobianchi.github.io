This is a blog about all the technical and non technical things I find interesting and I want to write and learn about. I will try to write about things I learn, things I find interesting and things I want to work on in the future. Hopefully this is not only useful for myself in the future but also for any other person that has the same interests as me.

This blog is build using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it is hosted in [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
